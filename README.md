Date: 2015-08-07
(Note: CHAD is currently experimental)

System Requirements:

OS X (for now - involves an issue with sed. Linux/Unix approved sed commands to be added soon)
Python 2.7 (anaconda works well and contains most of the packages needed)
IDV (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/) with the 'runIDV' command line executable added to your path

Instructions:

After downloading the notebooks, the CHAD module, and the IDV load bundles to your favorite directory (let's call it .../CHAD/ for now), run 'ipython notebook' within your .../CHAD/ folder. From there, you can test CHAD by simply opening the CHADLoader_RemoteFiles IPython notebook and execute!

If you come across any bugs or need assistance in using CHAD, please notify me at the E-mail listed above.
