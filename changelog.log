- minor update to add percentile information as a potential information display in CHAD when ClickHistDo's do() is called

version 0.24: 1/20/2016

- ClickHist is now locked in resolution, so resizing bug is resolved
- print statements updated for compatibility with Python 3.x

version 0.19: 11/19/2015
- re-fixed a bug where clicking anywhere but in the 2D histogram as the first click upon start would freeze the 2D histogram functionality
- changes to the ClickHistDo_IDV file requiring a user to specify a start date for the data and an output bundle template
- switched the default bundle used for GEOS5 CHAD Notebook
- added a new bundle to the Bundles folder for reanalyses and observations
- added a MERRA CHAD Notebook for testing (for now loading CFSR into CHAD)
- experimental: added optional lon/lat width arguments (lonOffset=..., latOffset=...) and time offsets (timeBeforeAfter=...) for IDV bundle processing
- experimental: added a new script (clickHistIDVPre.py) that preprocesses any IDV bundle for use with CHAD's IDV implementation

version 0.18: 10/29/2015
- fixed a bug where clicking anywhere but in the 2D histogram as the first click upon start would freeze the 2D histogram functionality

- Removed some old files

version 0.14: 10/14/2015
- Added “Metadata” argument - currently used in CHAD as movie/image label when .isl script is run
- CHAD Percentiles are now correct in output files
- ClickHist also has percentiles calculated for option in a Do Script
- Fixed a bug where different numbers of bins for x and y would cause ClickHist to crash
- Fixed a bug where the input variable name was used for plot labeling instead of the cleaner name

version 0.13: 9/25/2015
