version 0.20: 11/30/2015
- ClickHist is now in Open Beta status instead of Experimental (though perhaps just semantics)
- ClickHist is now locked in resolution, so resizing bug is resolved
- print statements updated for compatibility with Python 3.x

version 0.19: 11/19/2015
- re-fixed a bug where clicking anywhere but in the 2D histogram as the first click upon start would freeze the 2D histogram functionality
- changes to the ClickHistDo_IDV file requiring a user to specify a start date for the data and an output bundle template
- switched the default bundle used for GEOS5 CHAD Notebook
- added a new bundle to the Bundles folder for reanalyses and observations
- added a MERRA CHAD Notebook for testing (for now loading CFSR into CHAD)
- experimental: added optional lon/lat width arguments (lonOffset=..., latOffset=...) and time offsets (timeBeforeAfter=...) for IDV bundle processing
- experimental: added a new script (clickHistIDVPre.py) that preprocesses any IDV bundle for use with CHAD's IDV implementation

version 0.18: 10/29/2015
- fixed a bug where clicking anywhere but in the 2D histogram as the first click upon start would freeze the 2D histogram functionality
- updated the 'SKEDot' parameters in the GEOS5 CHAD notebook to reflect new calculations

version 0.17: 10/19/2015
- changed name of 'KEDot' in the GEOS5 CHAD to 'SKEDot' and fixed units

- made CHAD output more verbose when saving a file for user to verify result
- changed the default .xidv bundle for CHAD
- pointed CHAD GEOS5 notebook to new data location
- fixed a bug with CHAD dealing with .xidv bundle time

version 0.15: 10/16/2015
- Eliminated log10 warnings from calculations
- Added stamp with version and known bugs
- Added .zidv functionality to the .isl script in CHAD for saving subset of data for offline use (most recent nightly build of IDV needed for this to work)
- Removed some old files

version 0.14: 10/14/2015
- Added “Metadata” argument - currently used in CHAD as movie/image label when .isl script is run
- CHAD Percentiles are now correct in output files
- ClickHist also has percentiles calculated for option in a Do Script
- Fixed a bug where different numbers of bins for x and y would cause ClickHist to crash
- Fixed a bug where the input variable name was used for plot labeling instead of the cleaner name

version 0.13: 9/25/2015
- removed some of added functionality of V0.12: isl script is made, but not run - left for user to automate at his leisure
- updated all string formats to match newer standard

version 0.12: 9/24/2015
- added functionality where CHAD spawns an IDV session to create a movie and image from the created bundle instead of simply writing the bundle (this feature can be turned on or off in the ClickHistDo_IDV.py file near the top)
